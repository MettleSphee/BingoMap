# BingoMap

This is an example in HTML/JS of a "custom" bingo display. It will show the date, number of lines, number of "acquired" squares, and a total percentage. There's also a message specific to values of percentages, and a "Coming Soon" message for a future planned result.

I've thought that it's best to hardcode the values for drawing the lines for the bingos, respectively the circles for the values obtained. The data is stored in the scores.js file. There are better ways to store and obtain it, but for a fast and easy bingo "webapp", I've thought of storing it as a variable.

These are meant to be used with a 5x5 bingo map acquired right on the following page: https://myfreebingocards.com/bingo-card-generator, by saving the preview.

A modified version could allow for different sizes, images and customization.
